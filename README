Even wanted to chuck a grenade at your inferior-looking house in minecraft? Now you can!

Features:

    Eggs can now be grenades!
    Toggle-able command to turn on and off grenades.
    PermissionsBukkit / SuperPerms Support! 

Usage:

Have access to 'egg.grenade' (if permissions is enabled) or be an op (if the server doesn't have permissions) Type '/grenade' to toggle on egg grenades. Throw an egg or two at your target and watch as the egg explodes a couple seconds after impact! (Be careful where you're aiming!)
Permission Node:

- egg.grenade This permission node gives access to '/grenade'.

- egg.molotov This permission nod gives access to '/molotov'.

I'd like to extend a special thank you to all the wonderful people on #bukkitdev. This plugin wouldn't be out for weeks (if ever) without their help! Thanks guys!

Todo:

    Optional 'Cool down'
    Whatever else people want!
