Usage:

Have access to 'egg.grenade' (if permissions is enabled) or be an op (if the server doesn't have permissions) Type '/grenade' to toggle on egg grenades. Throw an egg or two at your target and watch as the egg explodes a couple seconds after impact! (Be careful where you're aiming!)
Permission Node:

- egg.grenade This permission node gives access to '/grenade'.

- egg.moltov This permission nod gives access to '/moltov'.

I'd like to extend a special thank you to all the wonderful people on #bukkitdev. This plugin wouldn't be out for weeks (if ever) without their help! Thanks guys!

Todo:

    Optional 'Cool down'
    Require you to buy grenades (iConomy support)
    Logging to server who threw a grenade and where
    Whatever else people want!
